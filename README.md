# dada2-symbionts-workshop

This hands-on workshop hosted by researchers from Minderoo Foundation’s Ocean’s Program (Research and Infrastructure and OceanOmics), will discuss considerations for assessing Symbiodiniaceae assemblages with amplicon sequencing and walk-through analysis of sequence data using the DADA2 pipeline.

## Primary workshop components
* Overview of coral-algal symbioses; marker genes; challenges and opportunities with ITS2.
* Step-by-step overview, from receiving fastq files and pre-processing up to production of a counts table using the DADA2 pipeline. 
Note: we will not be handling the analysis of sequences per-se. There is a lot of documentation online on how to visualize and statistically analyze these data types. 

## Workshop materials:
* Test sequences
* R code


## Context and recommend reading:
The internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) rDNA region is the most frequently used marker gene among reef researchers to identify Symbiodiniaceae lineages. This workshop will cover one processing approach (using the DADA2 pipeline) and discuss considerations for analyzing this type of data.
